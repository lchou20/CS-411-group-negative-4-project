Hello All, for our CS411 project we created a hotel finder that takes in an address and uses the google maps API's (places and geocoder) 
to locate the address and then find the hotel nearest that particular address. We also utilize the weather stack API in order to give 
weather information(tempurature in Celsius, weather description, feels like, windspeed, etc.) to the city or closest city to where that 
address is located.

How to use:

Ok so first go to the terminal then cd to the project. 
Then type in: “brew install node”. 
Then once that is complete type in: “npm install”. 
Then once thats complete type in: "node server.js” to start the server. 
Then open the link it provides in a browser. From there on the browser log into your 
BU email through the link at the top left. 
Then once thats complete type in an address that you want to look up. 
Use the formula Address, City, State, Zip Code, Country. 
Then it will give you the closest hotel and the closest city’s weather.


Thanks, Lance, Zachary, Sam, and Yuhang
